            <h2>Fyre Festival Reflects a Broader Issue of Minority Oppression in the Tech Industry</h2>

            <p id="p1">The infamous Fyre Festival is, once again, one of the biggest scams flooding social media, thanks to two documentaries released on Netflix and Hulu. The most popular posts seem to be laughing at the rich, privileged people who believed the lie and ended up spending thousands of dollars just to end up in conditions that were not very different from a run-down summer camp I went to as a child. They suffered a cramped, economy flight to a beach filled with wet, dirty beds in old tents. They had low-quality food, no running water, and their only amenity was a line of Porta-Potty’s... for one day. The articles about all the lawsuits and scandals seem to empathize so well with the proclaimed victims of this tragedy: model influencers who were paid to promote this festival under false pretenses, investors who were swindled into giving millions of dollars in funds, and the guests who paid for a top 1% experience but instead received a stressful ordeal of momentary confusion and run-down conditions.</p>

            <p id="p2">What caught my attention the most from this whole spectacle, however, was the damage done to the minority groups that weren’t considered valuable enough to be targets, but still profitable enough to be maliciously used and abused like disposable utensils by Billy McFarland in order to make this fake festival happen. As an LGBT woman of color seeking to build a career in the tech industry, Netflix’s documentary, <i>Fyre</i>, was more than just a review of a past mistake; it was a warning of the toxic climate that lies ahead.</p>

            <p id="p3">In the weeks leading up to the festival, <a href="http://gal-dem.com/fyre-festival-doc/">McFarland enslaved nearly every local worker on the island of Great Exuma.</a> For over a month, he exploited them for excruciating manual labor as they worked all hours of the day and night in harsh conditions. He valued neither the Bahamians professional knowledge, input, or experience; only the labor they produced. Not only is this reminiscent of racist and colonial themes throughout the United States and Bahamas, but it also mirrors the culture of racism found throughout the rest of the tech industry.</p>

            <p id="p4">The disaster of Fyre festival was not an isolated incident. If the CEO of a tech startup can get away with the enslavement of its workers of color, what are the leaders of the biggest and most successful tech companies capable of? <a href="www.facebook.com/notes/mark-s-luckie/facebook-is-failing-its-black-employees-and-its-black-users/1931075116975013/" target="_blank">Mark S. Luckie went public in November 2018</a> with his experience as one of the few black employees at Facebook. In his memo and following interview, he describes how only 4% of employees at Facebook are black, and how he faced hostility in his work environment from regular run-ins with security, being told directly by his manager not to engage in “black stuff” or the internal group chat for black employees, and facing the constant micro-aggressions of being deemed too “hostile” or “aggressive.” Furthermore, when teams need to review content for racism or connect with a trend in the black community, they have no problem consulting a black employee for their opinion. When it comes to setting up those teams, however, black employees are often excluded. Facebook’s racism also extends towards its users. Luckie continued to describe how although Facebook benefits the most from its black user base, black users are most likely to have their content and accounts removed from the site, even when not violating Facebook’s terms of service. These are all examples of how black people are profitable as consumers and grunt workers, but not valued as equals or for their ideological contributions to the business.</p>

            <p id="p5">Some of the most popular jokes surrounding Fyre Fest on social media revolve around McFarland’s mentor, colleague, and friend, Andy King. In <i>Fyre</i>, King admits that McFarland ordered him to perform sexual favors to a Bahamian Customs’ officer in order to receive a shipment they needed for the festival. Rather than listen to King’s suggestions about using management skills to effectively reduce the number of problems that arose or cancel the festival entirely, McFarland used him and his body for the results he could produce. This is a serious example of homophobia and sexual harassment that unfortunately, is also commonplace in the American tech industry.</p>

            <p id="warning">Warning: the following clip explicitly describes an incident of sexual harassment. Viewer discretion is advised.</p>

            <p id="p6"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/27/tech-industry-sexism-racism-silicon-valley-study" target="_blank">A study from The Guardian</a> found that "LGBT tech workers were the most likely to experience bullying and hostility, with 25% citing “rude and condescending behavior” and 24% saying they were publicly humiliated or embarrassed. A majority of LGBT+ employees (64%) said bullying contributed to their decision to leave." It also reported that minority workers in tech are more likely to face discrimination than in other industries, twice as likely to leave their jobs because of discrimination than a better job opportunity, and “unwanted sexual attention was reported at rates almost twice as high among employees in the tech sector compared to tech employees in other industries.”

            <blockquote><i>"LGBT tech workers were the most likely to experience bullying and hostility, with 25% citing “rude and condescending behavior” and 24% saying they were publicly humiliated or embarrassed.

            <p id="p7">The solution to the problem of discrimination in tech is similar to what would have saved Billy McFarland and his Fyre festival: listen to your employees, especially if those employees come from underrepresented minorities. If McFarland has listened any of the times his colleagues had warned him against his actions, or followed any of their advice or proposals, he likely would not be spending the next 6 years in prison. The Guardian also claims that “the annual cost to tech companies for turnover due to unfairness could be $16bn.” If companies like Facebook, Uber, Apple, and Google made an effort to include more diversity in management and implemented bias training, they could save substantial amounts of money and avoid much-too-common public relations disasters.</p>

            <p id="p8">As a LGBT woman of color, I hope to work and grow with the company I join; not against it. One of my goals is to be taken seriously as a professional and contribute in a meaningful way towards the work environment. I want to look up to my colleagues and managers in admiration, instead of away in fear. I hope the industry can learn from the mistakes made by Billy McFarland and other exclusive leaders in tech, to value the minds of their minority workers as much as their bodies and the labor they produce.</p>
