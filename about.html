        <p class="intro">Hi! <br> <br> My name is Erin Brady, and I just completed Software Engineering Apprenticeship at Year Up, a nonprofit organization that works to close the opportunity divide by connecting young adults from low-opportunity backgrounds to companies that need professional talent in technology, business, and finance. During the program, I received 6 months of training in the fundamentals of Java, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby and completed a 6-month internship as a Software Developer at Walmart E-commerce.

        <br><br> My time at Walmart was focused on front-end development with React. I received first-hand experience in agile software development on a team of senior-level engineers that worked to develop internal web tools to give associates a comprehensive overview of the company's pricing system. My work involved using functional programming to build data visualization dashboards using libraries like Amcharts4 and Ag-grid, implementing AJAX with Hooks, conducting code reviews, writing unit tests, and even some graphic design work for the Pricing team's hackathon.
            
        <br><br> I achieved my Associate of Science degree in Multimedia Programming and Design in August 2019 at Borough of Manhattan Community College in New York City. I graduated with a 3.66 GPA and participated in the ACM-W (Association for Computing Machinery's Council on Women) chapter of the Programming club.
        
        <br><br> Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring the city's art and science museums and exhibits, engaging in social justice events, finding new ways to live and promote a sustainble, zero-waste lifestyle and getting out of town for various adventures in the great outdoors.

        <br><br>I hope you enjoy my work and please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! I am open to full-time employment roles and I appreciate all types of feedback.</p>
