            <h2>Sexual Objectification in Graphic Design</h2>

            <p id="credit">Written by Erin Brady on Mon, March 5, 2018<br>

            <div id="billboard">
                <img src="images/ufitness.jpg">
                <p class="caption"></p>
            </div>

            <p id="p1">Presented here is an advertisement for the gym, <i>U-Fitness</i>, that was strategically placed halfway along the route of the Cardiff Half Marathon in 2016. It shows a close-up of a woman’s backside in a thong as she rides an exercise bike, with a caption on the side that states, “There’s better things to be stuck behind than the car in front.” This says that if you work out at U-Fitness, you can enjoy this view for yourself in person. The ad uses gross sexual objectification to promote the gym.</p>

            <p id="p2"><a href="https://www.cabrillo.edu/~mmoore/imageswomen.html" target="_blank">Mik Moore, a professor in Sociology at Cabrillo College, presents seven common themes in the representation of women in advertising. </a> The themes used in this particular advertisement include the artificial look, dismemberment, and commodification. Moore describes dismemberment as "...presenting women as fragmented and disconnected body parts detracts from thinking about women as real people with their own intellect, feelings, dreams and desires. Women become objects for consumption." This is evident here because the close-up of this woman’s rear is the only visible part of her in this ad. This is not a woman living a healthy lifestyle to be stronger or better herself; her only purpose is to maximize male enjoyment by toning her glutes. She is not a whole person, she is only a butt. The artificial look comes into play here as well, with the way her body is edited. Lighting and photoshop enhancements are being utilized to uphold this woman to the physical standards of having a rear that’s totally round, a thigh gap, and no stretch marks or blemishes: expectations that are largely unattainable and unrealistic for the majority of women yet exceedingly reinforced through pervasive advertisements like this one. Artificial bodies being promoted as the ideal or superior female body contribute to real issues for women, like depression, low self-esteem, and eating disorders which can lead to dangerous lifestyle choices that can have devastating medical effects.</p>

            </div>

            <p id="p3">While this ad may not directly visually associate the woman with a product, which is oftentimes the case with commodification, it does present the woman as the product being sold. The ad vaguely represents the gym with its logo and exercise bike, but the primary selling point is the woman’s sex appeal. Gyms provide a service for their customers to have a place to exercise. When a gym advertises that this service includes the opportunity to ogle sexually appealing women, the female and product become interchangeable, and both are promoted as a pleasure service. Advertisements like this fuel a toxic culture already prominent in gyms, where women aren't safe because men feel entitled and encouraged to pursue and harass them.</p>

            <p id="p4">After this advertisement received controversy, U-Fitness did not apologize. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fury-over-sexist-gym-advert-8970185" target="_blank">One of the managers said: "It wasn't our intention to offend people and it wasn't at all done in a sexist or derogatory manner,"</a> completely denying the sexism blatant in their advertisement. Many people believe that ads like this are not offensive, for various reasons. One reason is that models get hired and paid to get these images taken of them, therefore empowering the women who choose this type of work. Another common argument is that people know advertisements are attempting to sell a product or service, and therefore don’t regard the images and slogans used in them to be serious representations of truth but take them lightly. The problem with these arguments is that their creators dismiss any responsibility for their decisions and actions, and ignore the consequence that they are contributing to a relentless onslaught of continuous sexual objectification not only in advertisements, but across all forms of media. This gross misrepresentation of women in the media directly contributes toward the sexist culture that permeates every facet of our society today. If companies refused to partake in sexual objectification, and instead used empowering images of women in their advertising, modern culture would shift towards being a more safe and open environment that would encourage over half of the population to support those progressive companies. Until then, they will continue to face backlash from #MeToo and other similar movements that combat harassment and rape culture.</p>
